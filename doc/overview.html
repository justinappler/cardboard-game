	<h2>Design Overview</h2>
	<p>
		The Design of the Immortal Labs CardBoard Game can be divided into two distinct
		parts, the Internal State and the External Display.
	</p>
	<h3>Internal State</h3>
	<p>
		The Internal State is managed by the Logic class which 'delegates 
		intelligence' to a set of classes that model the game while maintaining
		adherence to the rules.  These classes include SetsBoard, Timer, 
		SoundPlayer, Timer, HighScore, Deck, Score, and the interface
		CardBoardUI.  Each of these classes handles the various tasks and data
		elements necessary to run that specific component, such that the logic
		relies almost entirely on them to run the game.  This, in effect, 
		creates a modularized set of logical units each of which can be tested
		individually.  In addition, all of the logic for the game remains
		completely separate from any display code so that the eventual 
		interface is interchangeable.
	</p>
	<dl><b>Internal State Classes</b>
		<dt>Card</dt>
		<dd>
			The Card class contains all the necessary information to represent a Cardboard
			game card. It contains enumerations and "getter" methods for each attribute of
			the card.
		</dd>
		<dt>Score</dt>
		<dd>
			The Score class models each players score.  A score is a
			non-negative integer that can be increased or decreased 
			based on game play.  There are 3 cases that effect the score 
			of a player.  The score increases if player gets a correct set,
			the score decreases if the player gets an incorrect set, and 
			the score decreases if the player runs out of time.
		</dd>
		<dt>SetsBoard</dt>
		<dd>
			The SetsBoard class maintains the state of the game board by
			keeping track of what Cards are in the inlay and what Cards 
			are on the game board. Also the SetsBoard class determines 
			what is a set and can return information about the game board.
		</dd>
		<dt>Logic</dt>
		<dd>
			The Logic class maintains the state of a Sets game, abiding by
			the various rules and restrictions. The logic also processes the
			actions made by the user and updates the state to reflect those
			actions.
		</dd>
		<dt>CardBoardUI</dt>
		<dd>
			The CardBoardUI class is an interface that must implemented by 
			all user interfaces for the Cardboard Sets Game.
		</dd>
		<dt>Timer</dt>
		<dd>
			Counts the number of seconds that have passed continuously. Timer also
			will handle counting down a specified number of seconds and can have 
			a concurrent buzz-in count down timer.
		</dd>
		<dt>Deck</dt>
		<dd>
			Represents a stack of CardBoard cards in a random order. You can deal 
			card off the deck and ask the deck if it's empty.
		</dd>
		<dt>HighScore</dt>
		<dd>
			Models a high score list and can have up to 10 High Scores each of which 
			has a score value and a name associated with it.  When a High Score is 
			added to a full list, the lowest score is dropped from the list.
		</dd>
		<dt>SoundPlayer</dt>
		<dd>
			Loads and plays sound files. SoundPlayer will play four different types of 
			sounds depending on what is currently happening in the game.
		</dd>
		<dt>CardBoardPreferences</dt>
		<dd>
			The CardBoardPreferences maintains the current game preferences and key 
			bindings. It allows the preferences and key bindings change during a game 
			and persist the values so they will be saved for future games.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<h3>External Display</h3>
	<p>
		The External Display consists of all the classes that take part in 
		displaying information about the game state.  The division of labor and
		the 'main loop' occur in the GameWindow class, which handles the
		creation of the game window itself, as well as places the individual 
		graphic components, each of which handles their own drawing.
	</p>
	<dl><b>Internal State Classes</b>
		<dt>CardGraphic</dt>
		<dd>
			The CardGraphic class is used to draw the Cardboard game cards in the GameWindow. It does 
			this by extending Component and overwriting the paint method. This class also contains 
			methods to animate and scale the cards appropriately.
		</dd>
		<dt>Button</dt>
		<dd>
			The Button class is used to draw one of the three Cardboard game buttons 
			in the GameWindow. The type of button to be created is defined in the Button 
			constructor using the ButtonType enumeration.
		</dd>
		<dt>HighScoreWindow</dt>
		<dd>
			The HighScoreWindow class creates a window that lists the top ten highest scores. 
			This class retrieves the scores from an instance of the HighScore class.
		</dd>
		<dt>ScoreGraphic</dt>
		<dd>
			The ScoresGraphic class displays the information of
			all the player's Score's in a graphical display.  It uses 
			the Score class to get the information about the score and 
			then displays it.
		</dd>
		<dt>TimerGraphic</dt>
		<dd>
			The TimerGraphic class graphically displays the information from 
			a Timer class.
		</dd>
		<dt>GameWindow</dt>
		<dd>
			Displays the state of the CardBoard game in a single window.
		</dd>
		<dt>GameBoardMenu</dt>
		<dd>
			The Menu class instantiates a menu for the game window to use. The 
			menu includes new games, preferences, and key bindings. 
		</dd>
		<dt>KeyBindings</dt>
		<dd>
			The KeyBindings class models all key binding for
			the game. If a player changes any key bindings, the class 
			persist it to retain the information for future games.
		</dd>
		<dt>KeyBindingsWindow</dt>
		<dd>
			The KeyBindingsWindow class models a window for a user 
			to change all key binding for the game.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<h3>Other Classes</h3>
	<p>
		While nearly all classes are responsible for either controlling or 
		displaying the Game State, there are 2 classes that intentionally
		fall into neither category.  The first is the CardBoardApp which 
		creates both the GameWindow and the Logic classes.  The second is the
		ActionMap class, which maps button presses and mouse clicks to various
		Logic and GameWindow actions.  This creates a filter between the User
		and the internal workings of the software so that less interpretation
		work is done by	the Logic and GameWindow class and no code is duplicated
		in both of the aforementioned classes.
	</p>
	<h3>Class Interactions</h3>
	<p>
	    The most interesting class interactions occur between ActionMap, 
	    GameWindow, Logic, and CardGraphic class. As seen in the diagram below a mouse
	    click on a card graphic is handled by the ActionMap class. ActionMap then 
	    retrieves the source of this click, a CardGraphic class, and passes this to 
	    the GameWindow class. GameWindow then tells the CardGraphic class to begin 
	    its animation process. This animation is handled on its own thread. Once 
	    this is done, CardGraphic calls ActionMap's cardClicked with the 
	    CardGraphic. This is done so that the state of the game is not corrupted
	    by the animation and the Logic class never has to worry about the 
	    intermediate state of animation, a construct purely of the UI. ActionMap 
	    then tells the GameWindow to set the card graphic as selected and tells the
	    Logic a card has been chosen which then asks the GameWindow class for the
	    selected card.

	<h2>Design Issues</h2>
	<p>
		Several design issues were encountered during the design of this
		application and while they have all been resolved, the rationale behind
		the choices can be useful to those understanding the functionality of
		this system.
	</p>
	<h3>Enumerations vs. Strings/Ints</h3>
	<p>
		The use of enumerations is widespread throughout this project.  For
		example, in the GameWindow class, we enumerate the possible number of
		rows (4-7) instead of simply representing it with an integer or Natural.
		The reason for this is because we found that first, the underlying value
		can still be retrieved, and second, that is prevents a situation in which
		a class attempts to pass an invalid value, which requires a 'catching'
		mechanism on the calling side and a throwing mechanism on the called side.
		Removing this possibility simplifies code, reduces code 'nooks and
		crannies' often tedious to find in testing, and make the code more
		readable and easy to understand.
	</p>
	<h3>Naming Choices</h3>
	<p>
		The SetsBoard, which contains a proprietary name, was chosen on purpose.
		While it may seem like it is not in the problem domain, it is, in fact,
		drawn directly from it.  First, we wanted to avoid the class name
		CardBoardBoard, which when coupled with the package name would be very 
		confusing.  Mostly, though, was that the class does exactly what it is 
		named, represents a board for the game Sets.  This is same situation
		that might occur when creating a variation of the Poker game 'Texas Hold'Em'.
		While we may want to call the board 'KentuckyHoldEmTable', it is more
		accurately referred to as a 'PokerTable', as it is more abstract than the
		former.
	</p>
	<h3>Action Map Justification</h3>
	<p>
		One of our primary goals in creating this design was to prevent the logic/UI
		integration that can inhibit future developers from porting the application
		to a different user interface.  To do this, we decoupled as much as possible
		the Models from the Views.  The result of this is our 2 'side' design.
		However, we quickly discovered that there are situations where the
		there is a close relationship between UI and Logic code.  Instead of breaking
		the 'invisible wall', we created a class that, in some respects, straddles it.
		The ActionMap allows us to map user inputs to actions in either the user
		interface or the logic.  For example, while clicking on a card on the game
		board should ultimately inform the logic that a card has been moved to the inlay,
		the ActionMap first informs the UI of the action so that it can animate the card
		and then informs the logic that the card has been moved.  This allows animation,
		a construct purely of the user interface, to go on entirely unbeknownst to the
		logic itself.
	</p>
	<h3>SoundPlayer Usage</h3>
	<p>
		The SoundPlayer class currently resides in the 'game' package and is used by the
		Logic class.  While it is technically an 'interface' (hearing) with the user,
		we decided to have it interact directly with the logic because it is a 
		non-portable aspect of the design.  In other words, because it is written in Java
		and is thus platform independent, there is no need to port it for another platform.
		Furthermore, because it is a direct requirement of the project, there is no 
		foreseeable reason need to have the interface through which it works change either.
	</p>
	<h2>Data Structures</h2>
	<p>
		While most data structures used in this project are fairly uninteresting, some were
		purposely chosen for their design benefits.
	</p>
	<h3>SetsBoard</h3>
	<p>
		For the SetsBoard's board and inlay we chose to use an array of Cards as opposed to
		some sort of list or multi-dimensional array.  First, the array allows us to leave 
		'null' in locations to indicate a missing card.  Second, the single dimensional array
		makes it easier to iterate over and still quite easy to pull an item from (cartesian
		locations are turned into array indicies in the same fashion that they are done in heaps).
